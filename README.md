- Copying a list of files from the file manager and pasting in cherrytree will create a list of links to files, images are recognized and inserted in the text

- Export to html of a selection / node / node and subnodes / the whole tree
- Export to plain text of a selection / node / node and subnodes / the whole tree
- Toc generation for a node / node and subnodes / the whole tree, based on headers h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 and text sections between headers collapsible
- Find a node, find in selected node, find in selected node and subnodes, find in all nodes
- Replace in nodes names, replace in selected node, replace in selected node and subnodes, replace in all nodes
- Iteration of the latest find, iteration of the latest replace, iteration of the latest applied text formatting
- Import from html file, import from folder of html files
- Import from plain text file, import from folder of plain text files
- Import from basket, cherrytree, epim html, gnote, keepnote, keynote, knowit, mempad, notecase, rednotebook, tomboy, treepad lite, tuxcards, zim
- Export to cherrytree file of a selection / node / node and subnodes / the whole tree
- Password protection (using https://www.7-zip.org/) available only for storage as single file – NOTE: while a cherrytree password protected document is opened, an unprotected copy is extracted to a temporary -folder of the filesystem; this copy is removed when you close cherrytree
- Tree nodes drag and drop
