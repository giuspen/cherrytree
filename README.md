# cherrytree fork 

Main goal for this fork is to add new functions to code like:
- add plugins support (initial support done)
- add some plugins to extend cherrytree (plugins already added: screenshot)
- move some core functions to plugins
- in far future add support for central server repository for group work (or something similar)

There is no warranty that changes in this fork will be accepted in upstream someday. Hopfully some of them will.

Testers are welcome!

Please do not use devel branch. Code in that branch can be unstable and broken. Use master branch. In future use stable tag or realase branches
